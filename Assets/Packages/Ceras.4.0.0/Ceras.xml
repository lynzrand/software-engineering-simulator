            <summary>
            When using the formatter generator you should have a static method somewhere that returns a SerializerConfig, the tool will find the method using this attribute and then execute it so it can use the same config that you are using when the program runs.
            That way the generator knows what types to generate formatters for, and what members to include or exclude.
            The tool inspects 'KnownTypes' as well as all types that you configured using the ConfigType methods. Types that are only handled in "OnConfigNewType" will not be handled in any way because that method is only called when any type is actually encountered (serialized or deserialized).

            The formatter generator looks for it and generates formatters only for types with the attribute.
            If a base type (for example 'abstract class NetworkMessage') has this attribute, then all derived types that the tool can find will also have a formatter generated for them.

            the serializer/deserializer has to be exactly the same, meaning the same classes with the same type-codes

            To make all this easier, the serializer simply puts all the information into this class.
            - constructs the dynamic serializers directly when the serializer gets created
            - optionally emits a checksum into the binary (just 1 int)

             <summary>
             If you want to, you can add all the types you want to serialize to this collection.
             When you add at least one Type to this list, Ceras will run in "sealed mode", which does 2 different things:
             
             <para>
             1.) It improves performance.
             Usually Ceras already only writes the type-name of an object when absolutely necessary. But sometimes you might have 'object' or 'interface' fields, in which case there's simply no way but to embed the type information. And this is where KnownTypes helps: Since the the types (and their order) are known, Ceras can write just a "TypeId" instead of the full name. This can save *a lot* of space and also increases performance (since less data has to be written).
             </para>
            
             <para>
             2.) It protects against bugs and exploits.
             When a new type (one that is not in the KnownTypes list) is encountered while reading/writing an exception is thrown!
             You can be sure that you will never accidentally drag some object that you didn't intend to serialize (protecting against bugs).
             It also prevents exploits when using Ceras to send objects over the network, because an attacker can not inject new object-types into your data (which, depending on what you do, could be *really* bad).
             </para>
             
             By default this prevents new types being added dynamically, but you can change this setting in <see cref="!:Advanced.SealTypesWhenUsingKnownTypes"/>.
             
             <para>Ceras refers to the types by their index in this list!</para>
             So for deserialization the same types must be present in the same order! You can however have new types at the end of the list (so you can still load old data, as long as the types that an object was saved with are still present at the expected indices)

            If your object implement IExternalRootObject they are written as their external ID, so at deserialization-time you need to provide a resolver for Ceras so it can get back the Objects from their IDs.
            When would you use this?
            There's a lot of really interesting use cases for this, be sure to read the tutorial section 'GameDatabase' even if you're not making a game.

            that belong into an object-graph and save them at the same time. That's when you'd use this callback.

             If you use KnownTypes you're most likely using Ceras in a network-scenario.
             If you then turn off this setting, you're basically allowing the other side (client or server) to construct whatever object they want on your side (which is known to be a huge attack vector for networked software).
            
             It also protects against bugs by ensuring you are 100% aware of all the types that get serialized.
             You could easily end up including stuff like passwords, usernames, access-keys, ... completely by accident. 
             
             The idea is that when someone uses KnownTypes, they have a fixed list of types they want to serialize (to minimize overhead from serializing type names initially),
             which is usually done in networking scenarios;
             While working on a project you might add more types or add new fields or things like that, and a common mistake is accidentally adding a new type (or even whole graph!)
             to the object graph that was not intended; which is obviously extremely problematic (super risky if sensitive stuff gets suddenly dragged into the serialization)

             This does not help against: renaming types themselves, changing the type of a member while keeping the name (you'd need to rename the member so it won't conflict with any old data).

             1) It is possible to do "get or add" in a single lookup using <see cref="M:Ceras.Helpers.TypeDictionary`1.GetOrAddValueRef(System.Type)"/>. For
             values that are value types, this also saves a copy of the value.
             2) It assumes it is cheap to equate values.
             3) It assumes the keys implement <see cref="T:System.IEquatable`1"/> or else Equals() and they are cheap and sufficient.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             1) This avoids having to do separate lookups (<see cref="M:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.TryGetValue(`0,`1@)"/>
             followed by <see cref="M:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.Add(`0,`1)"/>.
             There is not currently an API exposed to get a value by ref without adding if the key is not present.
             2) This means it can save space by not storing hash codes.
             3) This means it can avoid storing a comparer, and avoid the likely virtual call to a comparer.

            A type binder is simple. It is responsible to converts a type to a string and back.
            For generic types it must do so by deconstructing the type though. So giving <see cref="!:List&lt;int&gt;"/> would return "System.Collections.List".

            This simple type binder does two things:
            <para>- does the basic ITypeBinder thing (converting types to names, and back)</para> 
            <para>- allows the user to add assemblies that will be searched for types</para>

            <summary>
            Put your own assemblies in here for Ceras to discover them. If you don't and a type is not found, Ceras will have to look in all loaded assemblies (which is slow)
